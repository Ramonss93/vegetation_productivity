  Abstract                 = {In situ collected spectrometer data were used to evaluate and quantify the relationships between various linear combinations of red and photographic infrared radiances and experimental plot biomass, leaf water content, and chlorophyll content. The radiance variables evaluated included the red and photographic infrared (IR) radiance and the linear combinations of the IR/red ratio, the square root of the IR/red ratio, the IR-red difference, the vegetation index, and the transformed vegetation index. In addition, the corresponding green and red linear combinations were evaluated for comparative purposes. Three data sets were used from June, September, and October sampling periods. Regression analysis showed the increased utility of the \{IR\} and red linear combinations vis-à-vis the same green and red linear combinations. The red and \{IR\} linear combinations had 7% and 14% greater regression significance than the green and red linear combinations for the June and September sampling periods, respectively. The vegetation index, transformed vegetation index, and square root of the IR/red ratio were the most significant, followed closely by the IR/red ratio. Less than a 6% difference separated the highest and lowest of these four \{ER\} and red linear combinations. The use of these linear combinations was shown to be sensitive primarily to the green leaf area or green leaf biomass. As such, these linear combinations of the red and photographic \{IR\} radiances can be employed to monitor the photosynthetically active biomass of plant canopies. },
